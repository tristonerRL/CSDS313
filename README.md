# CSDS313
Final Project for CSDS 313 Introduction to Data Analysis

This is an analysing and improving project based on the research for the paper [1].

The jupitor notebook course\ project.ipynb contains several sections of our experiment:

1. Reproduction of the experiments in the paper 
2. Comparasion of the popularity bias and concentration bias between Incremental ApproSVD and the traditional Incremental SVD algorithms
3. Evaluation of the performance for the post-processing mechanism on the reduction of popularity bias and concentraion bias
